  |                                                                         |
  |   A single male student enrolls into Mihama Private Academy, a          |
  |   mysterious school surrounded by tall walls on every side.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   His name is Yuuji Kazami.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Tired of being controlled by a sinister destiny, and a "job" that     |
  |   offers him no purpose in life, Yuuji takes some time away to get a    |
  |   taste of the student life.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The only other students enrolled at the school are five girls.        |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As Yuuji gets to know the girls, and gets used to their unique        |
  |   personalities, he begins to unravel the reasons for their             |
  |   enrollment.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   He may not think of himself as anything special, but he may just be   |
  |   the salvation the girls need to save themselves from the darkness     |
  |   that looms over them.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Bound to a past that keeps catching up with him, Yuuji's battle       |
  |   begins as he encounters a series of events that will change the       |
  |   unwritten laws of his world.                                          |
  |                                                                         |
